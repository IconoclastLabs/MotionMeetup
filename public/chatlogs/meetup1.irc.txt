[18:54] <mattsgarrison> our times are flexible, and will be largely dependent on the guest we bring on
[18:54] <@lrz> we should revive the newsletter

[18:55] <iwarshak> lrz: I'm glad for WeakRef, and I'd like to see the memory gc explained more in the docs.
[18:55] <doug316_> lrz: When there's a crash with a call stack, i.e. "(0x4a58012 0x319ae7e 0x15128c4 0x709252 0x7058a5 0x1)", will that someday produce a useful backtrace?

[18:55] <@colinta> Dan2552: there's been a few announcements on the mailing list, and @RubyMotion will def tweet them
[18:55] <@lrz> iwarshak: noted, we should improve the memory section in the runtime guide
[18:55] <@colinta> mattsgarrison: hey, i'm trying as hard as i can, not all of us can grow a fancy pants beard like yours!!
[18:56] <sail> doug316_: me too
[18:56] <@lrz> doug316_: on the device, never, because symbolication is not allowed, but we have a plan to automatically symbolicate crash reports
[18:56] <@colinta> k, and i'm finally caught up in the IRC log, and i'm pretty sure this is real time now
[18:56] <wndxlori> @lrz: is there way that a time-limited version could be used for training/intro/trial stuff?  I hear a lot of people say they are interested, and then veer off at the cost, just to try things out.
[18:56] <@lrz> doug316_: so, the app crashes and the report will be retrieved into your project directory. also, if you use the debugger, symbolication works there (because we have the dSYM available)
[18:56] <jamonholmgren> I actually think the $200 cost keeps the riffraff out :)
[18:57] <iwarshak> lrz: i'd be ok with paying even more for RM. especially if that got me something like priority support or something along those lines
[18:57] <@GantMan> ^ agreed with Jamonholmgrn
[18:57] <muescha> @Markvilla: yes because i expected it in 23h
[18:57] <iwarshak> I think RM is underpriced
[18:57] <jamonholmgren> I bought two licenses for my studio
[18:57] <neshmi_> I'd rather see the $200 stay if it means a higher quality product for the rest of us
[18:57] <jamonholmgren> underpricing problem solved
[18:57] <@lrz> wndxlori: it has been asked quite a few times,  i don't know yet how i will organize that :/
[18:57] <mattsgarrison> Markvilla: we plan on localizing the time on the site for the next one

[18:58] == natevick [~nvick@pfsense.newheights.org] has joined #rubymotion
[18:58] <jamonholmgren> So this IRC channel is pretty active?
[18:59] <BeautifulFunc> Looking forward to more tutorials and screencasts in the new site for noobs like myself.
[18:59] <iwarshak> lrz for those who are independent, and make their living using RM, 200 is a steal
[18:59] <markrickert> I'd really like to get the rest of my team involved with RubyMotion… having an enterprise licensoe would be great… I could bay you lots of money and be able to install it on all my developer's machines.
[18:59] <@colinta> jamonholmgren: it comes and goes :-)
[18:59] <wndxlori> I have no problems with the price.  In fact, I'd probably pay more.  But the cost is an entry barrier that hurts adoption for newbs.
[18:59] <@lrz> iwarshak: i agree, and yet, people complain it's too expensive (even the 99/y update :))
[18:59] <markrickert> *bay = pay
[18:59] <jamonholmgren> There's a student price, @wndxlori -- it's quite a bit less. Might help?
[18:59] <ashish_> yeah there should be some kind of trial license or something of that sort , less feature :/

[19:00] <ashish_> featured**
[19:00] <wndxlori> oh, that's not bad.  i was unaware of the student discount.
[19:00] <zef> Also, just another idea you may have considered. Simulator only version for free, but pay to run it on the device — just like Apple.
[19:00] <@lrz> jamonholmgren: i'm here every day (when i don't forget to start the client)
[19:00] <jamonholmgren> @lrz you'll regret telling me that

[19:03] <mattsgarrison> fyi, first recording was ~ 51minutes long
[19:03] <jamonholmgren> I found a nice gem for continuous testing, "when-files-change" -- works great (runs rake spec every time a file changes)
[19:03] <jamonholmgren> like Guard but no setup
[19:03] <Markvilla> @lrz do you have any benchmarks of objc vs rm compiling times?
[19:03] <ashish_> @lrz also is there something out there , such we can maintain multiple RM versions just like ruby on CI machines ?
[19:03] <mattsgarrison> Recording can currently be rewatched here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pel-0XS-mJc
[19:04] <@lrz> Markvilla: comparing compilation times, RM is way slower than objc... an order of magnitude slower
[19:04] <mattsgarrison> i'll edit / trim the intro
[19:04] <BeautifulFunc> lrz: any update on the rubymine and rubymotion 2.0 issue?
[19:04] <@lrz> but i have never worked on getting it faster, so there are lots of low-hanging fruits to collect

[19:05] <@lrz> in the meantime, downgrading to 1.35 works

[19:06] <Markvilla> ashish_ it should be easy to write a script to download and archive all of them, "motion update --force-version=1.XX" @colinta correct me if im wrong
[19:06] <jamonholmgren> The reason I asked about the module methods overriding Obj-C methods is it makes including ProMotion in your own ViewController kind of messy. Once we can override with module methods it'll be beautiful.
[19:06] <@lrz> Markvilla: correct
[19:07] <doug316_> Yes, rbenv support would work

[19:07] <doug316_> Or a gem for that matter
[19:07] <@GantMan> lrz: Will your RM site v2.0 have a place for templates to be featured/listed?
[19:08] <Markvilla> doug316_ support could definitely be added, but it would be trickier since you cant tell 'motion' to download it to a custom path (afaik)
[19:08] <@lrz> GantMan: project templates? yeah probably, we have a whole "developers" section
[19:08] <jamonholmgren> Why doesn't Apple embrace RubyMotion? It makes iOS programming fun.

[19:10] <@colinta> were they using ru
[19:10] <@colinta> rubymotion?
[19:10] <ashish_> because they went bankrupt last dec :/
[19:10] <@lrz> GantMan: i have no idea, but the people i knew left the company
[19:10] <@GantMan> I can't imagine anyone not wanting to use it over Obj-C
[19:11] <Markvilla> @lrz do you see Xamarin as reference for where Rubymotion could be in some time?
[19:11] <@lrz> Markvilla: as a reference i don't know, but the xamarin folks are remarkable (i'm a big fan of miguel :))
[19:12] <@lrz> we might be working together on the test cloud stuff
[19:12] <Markvilla> nice :D
[19:12] <Markvilla> you mean the Travis integration and stuff?

[19:12] <@lrz> Markvilla: no, better! http://xamarin.com/test-cloud
[19:13] <@colinta> it takes getting used to… you have to hate it for a while :-)
[19:13] <jamonholmgren> I haven't been able to get past the hate stage for auto layout yet.
[19:13] <@lrz> they acquired LessPainful, during the conference, one of the founders was there and gave a talk about calabash

[19:14] <Markvilla> @lrz oh yeah I remember the Calabash talk :) awesome!
[19:15] <doug316_> Yes autolayout needs a DSL
[19:15] <@colinta> GantMan: well that's tricky, because you have to remove the "portrait" orientations and then add the "landscape" orientations
[19:15] <jamonholmgren> motion-layout does look okay, but the ASCII art thing...
[19:15] == neshmi [~neshmi@cpe-76-88-33-168.san.res.rr.com] has quit []

[19:15] <@colinta> doug316_: jamonholmgren: if i have time, i'd like to incorporate ideas from teacup's constraint DSL into motion-layout

[19:18] <jamonholmgren> @colinta, would there be a way to use the Teacup styles without the layout portion? I'm not as fond of the layout part but like the styles.
[19:18] <@colinta> oh yeah, for sure
[19:18] <@colinta> jamonholmgren: just don't use a "constraints" key
[19:19] <jamonholmgren> So the constraints key can only be used in a layout block?
[19:19] <@colinta> ahh, no that's the motion-layout syntax

[19:20] <jamonholmgren> Yeah, I should throw a quick gist of what I'd like to do up. Basically, use my ProMotion workflow but Teacup styles

[19:21] <doug316_> I wonder if using HMTL/XML just like web would work for adaptive layouts
[19:21] <seanlilmateus> colinta: I hope to work out this ideas soon, at the moment we need some feedback from the users
[19:22] <Markvilla> muescha you came in the best moment to find someone to help you :P

[19:23] <@colinta> everytime i go to press 'B' i press Enter instead

[19:23] <doug316_> I am using Pixate for styling and I have to ask myself why I can't just design views in HTML
[19:23] <Markvilla> doug316_ I dont think HTML syntax help, some of us write ios apps to run away from web hell :)
[19:23] <doug316_> Pixate = CSS
[19:23] <@colinta> doug316_: are you talking about a box-based thing?  i think UICollectionView would be a good thing to sit at the top
