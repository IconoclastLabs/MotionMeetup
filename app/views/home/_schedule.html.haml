            Get your questions ready for the originator and owner of RubyMotion.  We'll be talking about the RubyMotion
            roadmap with the head honcho.

            In my opinion Clay is one of the most agressive and talented RubyMotion programmers. He's not only a core committer with the RubyMotion group, he's the author of an excellent 
            %a{href: "http://pragprog.com/book/carubym/rubymotion"} RubyMotion book for beginners.
